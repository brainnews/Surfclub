Channel surfing on the internet

I love kickin' back and channel surfing on my couch. I also love the wealth of video content on YouTube.

But, sometimes I don't want to choose which YouTube video to watch. Taking away the burden of choice opens up the possibility to be surprised by what you find and harkens back to the era of cable before channel guides and DVRs.

# How to use
Input a word or hit shuffle to bring up a random video from YouTube.

# Roadmap
- A more interesting way to move from channel to channel by serving up related channels based on current channel (like jumping around on Wikipedia or Pinterest).
- Breadcrumbs that let you see your viewing history.
- Connection to YouTube accounts for favoriting, adding to lists, etc.
